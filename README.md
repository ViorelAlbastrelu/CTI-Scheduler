# Scheduler - Windows application

Univeristy group project that was intended to help us organize as a team, settle a hirerachy in the team and distribute task to optimize efficiency.\
The application is a windows client that helps users create an univerity schedule and optimize it.\
* It has drag and drop implementation
* Import data from .xlxs files
* Export schedule as .pdf file
* SQL local database to store all the data. 

The project is still rough and incomplete so only bits maybe usefull at the moment of writing this update.
